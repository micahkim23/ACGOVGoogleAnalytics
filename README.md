#Alameda County Google Analytics Website

##About

Uses [Google Analytics Superproxy](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/google-analytics-super-proxy) to display data about Alameda County's website traffic in charts and tables.

##How it works

Google Analytics Superproxy queries for data from Google Analytics and can interact with Google's APIs such as charts. The website grabs data from the server using dimensions, metrics, and an API query ID.

Features of Google Analytics Superproxy:

1. Multiple users can access quota data
2. Data can be cached
3. Auto-scheduling to update data
4. Error-logging (auto-pauses query), the website still displays older data
5. Tells you when you get a successful response
